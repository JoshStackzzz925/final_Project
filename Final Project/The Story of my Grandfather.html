     	   <h1>Welcome to the Wonderful Story of a Grandfather who had a Humble & Successful Kid.</h1>
     	   <p> My Grandfather was my life, my bestfriend, my world, MY EVERYTHING. He was always there for me when I really needed somebody to talk to, and express my feelings with. When I was young, he was very confident in himself, and was a very outgoing person... many people would look up to him because of smart choices he made, and how successful he was in his life.</p>
