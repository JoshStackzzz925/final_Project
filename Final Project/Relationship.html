      <p>My relationship with my grandfather was priceless... I always went with him everywhere to protect him, and to spend time with him. I never actually spend time with him because highschool was very stressful, and I was going through tough times. I was failing every class due to personal reasons, and it affected me personally and mentally. While I was going through those times, my grandfather helped me through all those moments... Every tear I cried, he would wipe them, and give the best advice I would ever get. He once told me, "Never give up just because you're going through something... overcome it, and be the best person you can be." Whenever you're in the water drowning, pick yourself up and dry yourself up. Try to never fall in that place ever again because it will put you in a uncomfortable position. </p>
