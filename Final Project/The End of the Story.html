      <p> I'm going to end this story with a quote from his heart... " You are the sponge, and you are drowning with so much water on you... You need to rinse up. The best thing to do is climb your way to the top, and put face your fears. Once everything comes into place... you put yourself in a better position in life. Don't ever fall back into the water. Keep that beautiful smile on your face, and remember that I love you with all my heart."</p>
