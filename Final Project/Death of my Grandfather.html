      <p> On January 23rd, 2013... My life turned into hell. This was the day that my grandfather passed away. I fell into a huge depression, and it almost made me do a huge mistake I never in life wanted to do, and that was to kill myself. It was hard to let go of a man who was your everything. Always fought your battles for you, and always cared for who you was personally. & that's one of the reasons why I loved him so much with all my heart. Nobody in this world can't replace a man like him... I just wish that he was here with me so I can hug him one more time and tell him how much I loved him with all my heart. This picture that's below was the final picture we took with him... This is the family picture.</p>
